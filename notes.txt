Programming Journey

I first heard of the computer game MazeWar in the early 80s. It was an early (maybe the first), first person shooter. I have never been a huge fan of computer games but over the years I have played several. MazeWar was interesting to me because it could be played on an ascii terminal like a VT100. I am just going to assume everyone knows what a VT100 was.

MazeWar is a relatively simple, multi-player game. Players wander around a maze and shoot at monsters and other players. You get points for shooting players or monsters and you lose points for being shoot.

I remember being pretty annoyed when I discovered the sys admin who was running things mentioned that he had arranged a "cheat" in which new players always entered the maze in front of the sys admin and with their back turned. This allowed the sys admin to get in several free shots.

Anyway, years later when my kids were just old enough to start playing computer game (sometime in the 90s), I implemented my version of MazeWar, just for fun. The kids enjoyed playing the game (mostly cuz their Dad made it) for a day or two. I had a version that used curses (curses was a ascii terminal library - again, you are probably too young to know about this sort of thing) to render the maze and another version that used simple line art.

Since then, I have often thought MazeWar would be a great way to experiment with new ideas and technologies. But I never got around to doing anything. Then I retired, then the novel Coronavirus struck. Suddenly I found myself with lots of time to scratch that MazeWar itch.

First, I needed a working MazeWar game. My previous versions are long gone but how hard could it be to create a new version? Besides, this way I could use Python or some other modern programming language. I could also build it using a client/server model to make some of planned UI experiments easier.

First Version

I had been using Python for most of my programming projects for the last 5 or 6 years so I decided to use Python. I thought about picking a new language like Rust or an old language like Lisp. But eventually I decided to use Python for the first version. I figured I could experiment with different implementation languages in the future.

I think Python's current popularity is interesting. 10 years ago there was quite a bit comparison between Python and Ruby. I used Ruby for about a year and it was probably the most pleasant to use programming language I have ever tried. However, even then it seemed to me that Ruby was not enjoying the widespread adoption of Python. Certainly that proved to be true in my personal experience.

Even though I once preferred Ruby, I am now very comfortable with Python. It is a reasonable language with decent documentation and wonderful libraries. On the other hand, I really don't like a few things about Python:
  - indentation to indicate code blocks (terrible choice responsible for more bugs than anything else I can think of)
  - crippled lambdas (Ruby blocks are dramatically better)
  - GIL (global interpreter lock)
However, none of these problems are so severe I avoid using Python (though sometimes when I run into the lastest indentation bug ...).

================================================
l == wall and c != wall   # center hallway
  draw diag wall
  if prev l != wall       # just passed an intersection
     draw prev l ending edge

l == wall and c == wall and prev l != wall
  draw short horizontal wall   # intersecting hallway & maybe face against wall

l != wall and c == wall and prev l != wall # weird parallel hallway
  draw short diag wall
  

l != wall and c != wall            # intersection from left
  draw short horizontal wall;
  if prev l == wall
     draw prev l ending edge

c == wall
  draw center box

c == other player or monster
  draw it
